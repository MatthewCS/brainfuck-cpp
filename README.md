# brainfuck++
Simple (and far from perfect) brainfuck interpreter written in C++. I may or may not work on this further.

To run the program, use the command `./main <path to brainfuck program>`.

I'd like to make some changes to this project at a later date. For example, what if we wanted to print an integer rather than an ASCII value?

NOTE: the impeccable.b sample program was lifted from here: `http://www.hevanet.com/cristofd/brainfuck/` Check out some of Daniel's other programs. They're really neat!
