# brainfuck++

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/2d090007e0204963bc5a8019131f6a93)](https://www.codacy.com/manual/MatthewCS/brainfuck-cpp?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=MatthewCS/brainfuck-cpp&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

Simple (and far from perfect) brainfuck interpreter written in C++. I may or may not work on this further.

To run the program, use the command `./main <path to brainfuck program>`.

I'd like to make some changes to this project at a later date. For example, what if we wanted to print an integer rather than its corresponding ASCII character?

## NOTES
-   The hello.b sample program was lifted from here: `https://fatiherikli.github.io/brainfuck-visualizer/` This is a really neat tool, and I encourage you to try it!
-   The impeccable.b sample program was lifted from here: `http://www.hevanet.com/cristofd/brainfuck/` Check out some of Daniel's other programs. They're really neat!
-   char.b and fib.b were lifted from here: `https://github.com/afvanwoudenberg/bf`
